# 3D Printed Prosthetic Arm 

Description

As part of my final year Engineering Design Project, 2 of my classmates and I are making a 3D Printed Prosthetic Arm that uses microcontrollers with EMG signals to replicate hand gestures using machine learning algorithms.

The arm was made using an open source 3D model that was tweaked to fit our design configurations. The orginal design used 3 servos to control finger movements. One was used for the thumb, one for the index finger, and one for the middle, ring and little finger. Since, we wished to focus on finger movements we sought to have 5 servos controlling a finger each. This made us remodel the finger designs to function with the additional servos. Each finger was remodelled using AutoDesk Fusion 360. In addition we also added grooves at the fingertips for a grip. 

Folders & Files

The files are divided into the modelling and the signal processing folders. The modelling folder contains all the stl files. Whereas the signal processing folder has the signal processing code as well as the Arduino code for the servos.
